### Scenario: Team Novacode at Work

**Background**:  
Team Novacode is a small software development team within **TechFlow Solutions**, a mid-sized company specializing in creating SaaS platforms for the healthcare industry. The team is currently working on **MediTrack**, a web application that helps clinics manage patient appointments, maintain medical records, and generate insurance reports. The software aims to provide a seamless user experience and integrate with third-party insurance providers.

**Team Composition and Workflow**:  
- **Sarah (Team Lead/Backend Developer)**: Manages the team, reviews code, and handles backend architecture.  
- **Jake (Frontend Developer)**: Focuses on UI/UX and the client-side of the application.  
- **Aisha (Full-Stack Developer)**: Bridges the backend and frontend, working on APIs and integrations.  
- **Liam (Junior Developer)**: Recently joined and contributes to smaller tasks but struggles with navigating the existing codebase.  

The team follows an **Agile workflow**, with two-week sprints. They use Git for version control and conduct daily stand-ups. Code reviews are scheduled but often rushed due to tight deadlines.

### Current Challenges:  

During the last sprint retrospective, the team identified several issues affecting their productivity and code quality:  

1. **Poor Naming Conventions**:  
   - Variable names like `x`, `temp`, and `data1` are common.  
   - Function names such as `doStuff()` or `processData()` lack clarity about their purpose.  

2. **Lack of Modularity**:  
   - Aisha pointed out a function in the backend (`generateReport`) that is nearly 200 lines long and handles everything from data retrieval to formatting and sending emails.  
   - Reusing parts of the function in other modules has become a challenge.  

3. **Inconsistent Formatting**:  
   - Indentation, spacing, and bracket placement vary across files.  
   - Some files use tabs, while others use spaces, leading to messy diffs in Git.  

4. **Complex Functions**:  
   - Jake highlighted a frontend function that calculates appointment availability. It contains deeply nested loops and conditionals, making debugging almost impossible.  

5. **Junior Developer Struggles**:  
   - Liam feels lost in the codebase because there are no clear comments or documentation explaining the logic or purpose of many functions.

### Task for the Learner:  

1. **Identify the Problems**:  
   - List the clean code principles that are being violated in the scenarios described.  

2. **Propose Solutions**:  
   - Suggest actionable steps for improving each issue (e.g., better naming conventions, refactoring strategies, or implementing coding standards).  

3. **Justify the Benefits**:  
   - Explain how your proposed changes will enhance:  
     - Team collaboration  
     - Code maintainability  
     - Overall software quality  

4. **Optional Bonus**:  
   - Design a simple example to refactor the `generateReport` function into smaller, more modular pieces.
