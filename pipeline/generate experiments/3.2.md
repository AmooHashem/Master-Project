### Prompt 2: Code Generation Based on Scenario

Using the following input, create a messy and poorly written codebase that reflects the challenges described. The codebase should:

1. Uses mock data from json files (not real backend)
2. be in pure html and css format
3. Reflect the software project described in the scenario (e.g., task management system, e-commerce platform).
4. Include intentional examples of bad practices aligned with the problems stated in the scenario:
   - Poorly named variables, functions, or classes.
   - Long, unstructured functions without clear responsibilities.
   - Code duplication and lack of modularity.
   - Inconsistent indentation or formatting.
   - Missing or excessive comments.
5. Be functional but demonstrate clear violations of clean code principles.
6. Include instructions for the learner to refactor and improve the code based on clean code principles, aligning with the issues highlighted in the scenario.

**Input:** A scenario  
**Output:** A poorly written initial codebase matching the scenario, with clear instructions for refactoring.
