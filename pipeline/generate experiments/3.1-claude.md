Create a scenario-based question focusing on clean code. The question should:

1. **Introduction**: Develop a fictional team, organization, or project in a real-world software development setting where clean code practices play a crucial role. Clearly define the team's roles, project scope, and organizational context. Ensure the scenario reflects a typical software development environment where challenges related to code quality, readability, and maintainability arise.

2. **Scenario**: Construct a detailed, realistic situation where the team faces obstacles directly linked to clean code principles. The scenario should involve challenges that require learners to apply their knowledge of clean code practices to solve real problems. Provide at least 5 distinct examples of challenges the team might face. These could include:
   - Technical issues, such as complex methods, unclear naming conventions, duplicate code, or inconsistent formatting.
   - Organizational hurdles, like differing coding standards across teams, resistance to refactoring, or lack of code review processes.
   - Process-related problems, like missing documentation, poor exception handling, or violations of SOLID principles.
   - Ethical dilemmas or risks, such as sacrificing code quality for speed, accumulating technical debt, or bypassing clean code practices under pressure.
   - Decision-making under pressure or time-sensitive conditions, e.g., balancing clean code principles with urgent feature delivery or legacy code maintenance.

3. **Task**: Ask learners to complete practical tasks directly addressing the challenges described. These tasks should be rooted in real-world problem-solving and align with the goals of improving the team's handling of clean code practices. Examples of tasks include:
   - Fix the code quality issues in a given codebase. You must not give any code (consider the codebase will attached next)
   - Propose a solution to improve code readability and maintainability, outlining the potential impact on team efficiency, future development, and system scalability.
   - Write a set of actionable clean code guidelines or best practices the team could adopt to avoid or resolve future code quality issues.
   - Develop a checklist or a process improvement plan to ensure consistent application of clean code principles.
   - Create a timeline or implementation plan for gradually improving code quality without disrupting ongoing development.

4. **Reflection and Analysis**: After learners complete the task, guide them to engage in critical thinking about their approach and solutions:
   - Compare the team's initial codebase with the refactored outcome and explain both the improvements and any challenges that arose during the cleanup process.
   - Suggest metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) that the team could use to track code quality over time, such as cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, or maintainability index.
   - Recommend ongoing practices for maintaining clean code, such as pair programming, regular code reviews, automated code analysis, or periodic refactoring sessions.
   - Reflect on how clean code practices may need to adapt as the codebase grows or as new technologies are introduced to the project.

**Output:** Provide a detailed scenario that incorporates the team, project, and the specific challenges they are facing, offering a robust and practical context for learners to explore and solve real-world problems related to clean code principles and practices.
