The book mentions **Git** in the context of software quality tools, specifically as a tool for **code versioning/branching** and facilitating **code reviews through pull requests**. Additionally, it connects Git with **DevOps**, **continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)**, **code quality assessment**, and **automated testing**.  

Based on this, here are **five closely related topics** that are discussed in the book:  

- **Software Configuration Management (SCM)** – Covers branching, merging strategies, and version control systems, which directly relate to Git’s functionality.  
- **DevOps and CI/CD** – Explores how Git integrates with automation tools for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.  
- **Software Quality and Code Review** – Discusses tools and methods for ensuring high code quality, including static and dynamic analysis tools.  
- **Release Engineering** – Explores best practices for software release management, including rollback strategies and automated deployment.  
- **Agile and Software Development Processes** – Examines how version control systems like Git support Agile methodologies through iterative development and collaboration.  

These topics provide deeper insights into how Git contributes to software development, quality assurance, and deployment automation.
