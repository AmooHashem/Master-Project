## **Project Aurora: Smart Building IoT Integration Platform**

**Scenario Overview:**  
You are part of a multi-disciplinary engineering team tasked with developing *Project Aurora*, a comprehensive platform to monitor and manage a smart building’s energy usage, security systems, and environmental controls. The platform consists of several modules:
- **IoT Sensor Module:** Collects data from distributed sensors (temperature, humidity, occupancy, etc.).  
- **Web Dashboard:** Provides building managers with real-time analytics and control.  
- **Mobile Application:** Offers residents a way to monitor their energy consumption and receive alerts.  
- **Firmware Assets:** Contains large binary files for sensor firmware updates and high-resolution imagery for security purposes.

Your team will work in an Agile environment using Git for version control and a variety of DevOps practices to ensure high-quality, reliable releases.

### **Stage 1: Project Initialization & Branching Strategy**

**Problem Statement:**  
Set up the project’s Git repository and design a branching model that supports concurrent development across multiple modules.

**Specific Conditions & Constraints:**
- **Repository Setup:**  
  - Initialize a central repository with a protected `main` (or `master`) branch.  
  - Create initial feature branches for each module (e.g., `feature/iot-sensors`, `feature/web-dashboard`, `feature/mobile-app`, `feature/firmware`).
- **Branching Model:**  
  - Adopt a branching strategy that facilitates isolated development, frequent integration, and a clear path for merging features.
  - Document the branching and merging strategy in a README file.
- **Agile Process Integration:**  
  - Define iteration/sprint goals for incremental development.
- **SCM Best Practices:**  
  - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
  - Use tags to mark key milestones.

### **Stage 2: Feature Development, Pull Request Management & Code Review**

**Problem Statement:**  
Implement a workflow to develop features concurrently, manage pull requests efficiently, and ensure code quality through systematic reviews.

**Specific Conditions & Constraints:**
- **Pull Request Strategy:**  
  - Each team member must work on feature branches and open pull requests (PRs) when a feature is ready for review.
  - Use Git’s refs and refspecs to manage pull request references efficiently.
- **Git Aliases & Automation:**  
  - Create Git aliases to automate fetching and checking out pull request references. For example, an alias to fetch all PR branches from the remote.
  - Demonstrate how to fetch a specific pull request locally for testing before merging.
- **Code Review & Quality:**  
  - Integrate static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) and dynamic testing frameworks into the review process.
  - Document the code review checklist and guidelines.
- **Collaboration:**  
  - Use Git’s commenting and review features to discuss changes, resolve conflicts, and approve PRs.

### **Stage 3: DevOps Integration & CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**

**Problem Statement:**  
Integrate your Git repository with a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for *Project Aurora*.

**Specific Conditions & Constraints:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**  
  - Configure a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to automatically trigger builds on new commits and merged PRs.
  - Ensure that the pipeline runs:
    - **Static Analysis:** Validate code quality using tools integrated in Stage 2.
    - **Unit & Integration Tests:** Automatically run test suites for each module.
    - **Deployment Scripts:** Deploy the application to a staging environment upon successful tests.
- **DevOps Best Practices:**  
  - Automate branch merging as part of the pipeline.
  - Monitor pipeline health and report errors back to developers promptly.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Document pipeline configurations and troubleshooting tips.

### **Stage 4: Managing Large Digital Assets with Git LFS / git-annex**

**Problem Statement:**  
Address the challenge of managing large binary assets (firmware files, high-resolution security images) without bloating the Git repository.

**Specific Conditions & Constraints:**
- **Asset Identification:**  
  - Identify which files (or file types) are large and should be managed using Git LFS or git-annex.
- **Tool Integration:**  
  - Set up Git LFS (or git-annex) to track the designated large assets.
  - Provide instructions on how to clone and fetch these assets efficiently.
- **Versioning:**  
  - Ensure that the versioning of large assets is in sync with the application code.
  - Test the retrieval and update process in a collaborative environment.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update project documentation to instruct new developers on how to work with these tools.

---

### **Stage 5: Release Engineering & Disaster Recovery**

**Problem Statement:**  
Prepare *Project Aurora* for its first major release while implementing robust disaster recovery and rollback strategies.

**Specific Conditions & Constraints:**
- **Release Management:**  
  - Develop and document a release process that includes version tagging, release notes, and automated deployment to production.
  - Use Git’s tagging features to mark stable releases.
- **Rollback & Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Implement rollback strategies in case a release causes issues (e.g., using Git to revert to a previous commit).
  - Develop automated scripts for quick deployment of backup versions.
  - Create a disaster recovery plan that balances the risk of data loss with system reliability.
- **Testing:**  
  - Simulate a disaster recovery scenario (e.g., corrupted data, failed deployment) and document the recovery process.
- **Compliance:**  
  - Ensure that all release engineering steps comply with Agile methodologies and DevOps best practices.

---

### **Stage 6: Reflection & Documentation**

**Reflection Prompt:**  
After completing all stages, each team is required to reflect on the project journey. In a comprehensive report, address the following:
- **Challenges Encountered:**  
  - Describe the difficulties faced at each stage, particularly with branching strategies, managing pull requests, and integrating CI/CD.
- **Solutions & Lessons Learned:**  
  - Explain how you applied Git refs/refspecs, Git aliases, and local testing of pull requests to streamline your workflow.
  - Discuss your experience managing large assets with Git LFS or git-annex.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of your disaster recovery plan and rollback strategies.
- **Process Improvement:**  
  - Reflect on how Agile practices and continuous integration influenced your development process.
  - Suggest improvements for future iterations of the project.

---

**Final Deliverable:**  
Each team will submit:
- The complete Git repository (including all configuration files, alias scripts, and documentation).
- A CI/CD pipeline configuration file (or files) with associated logs demonstrating successful builds and tests.
- A final report documenting challenges, solutions, and reflections as outlined in Stage 6.

This structured scenario provides a realistic, multi-faceted challenge that not only reinforces SCM, DevOps, code review, and release engineering concepts but also integrates specific Git techniques and disaster recovery strategies essential for modern software development.
