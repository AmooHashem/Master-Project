Based on the content of the SWEBOK book, here are five closely related subtopics associated with Git and version control:

1. **Software Configuration Management (SCM)** – A structured process that ensures the completeness, integrity, and traceability of software components throughout the development lifecycle.

2. **Software Change Control** – Covers requesting, evaluating, approving, and implementing software changes using version control systems to maintain history and prevent conflicts.

3. **Branching and Merging Strategies** – Techniques used to manage parallel development efforts within version control systems, including feature branches, hotfixes, and integration strategies.

4. **Software Release Management** – Ensuring controlled and systematic deployment of software versions, often utilizing version control to track and manage different releases.

5. **Configuration Auditing and Baseline Management** – Verifying that software versions adhere to predefined requirements and managing baselines to ensure consistency across different stages of development.

These subtopics provide a deeper understanding of Git and version control concepts within software engineering. Let me know if you need further elaboration!
