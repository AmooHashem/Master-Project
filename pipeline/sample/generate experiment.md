Create a step-by-step software engineering lab experiment based on scenario-based learning. The experiment should follow these conditions:  

1. The topic of the experiment is: [INSERT TOPICS].  
2. Students will work in teams of two and collaborate fairly on the tasks.  
3. The experiment should be structured as a progressive scenario where students face real-world challenges related to the topic. Each step should present a new condition that students must analyze and solve.  
4. Students should solve each challenge using problem-solving skills and coding. The coding part should be implemented in [SPECIFY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IF NECESSARY].  
5. The experiment should be conducted in a GitHub repository, where students push their work, create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and submit a final repository link to the instructor.  
6. Each step should have clear objectives, instructions, and expected deliverables.  
7. The final submission should include all necessary documentation, such as a README file, commit history, and issue tracking.  

Generate the full experiment description, including objectives, detailed step-by-step instructions, and evaluation criteria.
