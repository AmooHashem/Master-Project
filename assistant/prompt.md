**Prompt: Scenario-Based Clean Coding Training**  

I am a technical manager looking to train my team in clean coding principles. Please provide me with **a series of scenario-based coding questions** designed to teach and reinforce the following clean coding concepts:  

1. **Meaningful Naming**: Choosing clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.  
2. **Function Design**: Keeping functions small, focused, and doing only one thing.  
3. **Code Organization**: Structuring code to improve readability and maintainability.  
4. **DRY Principle**: Avoiding code duplication and promoting reuse.  
5. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Ensuring classes and modules have a single, well-defined purpose.  
6. **Refactoring**: Identifying and improving bad code without changing its functionality.  
7. **Testing**: Writing unit tests that are easy to understand and maintain.  

For each scenario:  
1. Start by describing a **realistic problem or situation** where bad coding practices lead to challenges for the team, such as difficult debugging, poor collaboration, or performance issues.  
2. Include a **sample code snippet** that reflects the issues described in the scenario.  
3. Provide **step-by-step tasks** for the trainee, asking them to solve the problem by improving the code to align with clean coding principles.  
4. Highlight how their solution can address the challenges mentioned in the scenario.  

Additionally, suggest how I, as the manager, can evaluate their solutions effectively, focusing on their ability to identify problems, apply clean coding principles, and explain their reasoning.  

The scenarios should be practical, relatable to developers, and adaptable to popular programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript.
