### Prompt 1: Scenario Design (Text-Based Question)

**Prompt:**  
Create a scenario-based question focusing on **clean code principles**. The question should:  

1. **Introduction**: Introduce a fictional team, organization, or project with specific roles and a realistic context for their work. Ensure the context reflects a real-world software development environment where **clean code principles** are vital.  
2. **Scenario**: Develop a realistic scenario where the team faces challenges directly tied to **clean code principles**. For example:  
   - A project with overly complex methods causing confusion during debugging.  
   - Inconsistent naming conventions across the codebase leading to misunderstandings.  
   - Legacy code with insufficient documentation making onboarding new developers difficult.  
   - A tight deadline leading to technical debt from neglecting clean coding practices.  
3. **Task**: Ask learners to complete specific tasks that directly address these challenges, such as:  
   - Propose a set of guidelines the team could adopt to ensure adherence to **clean code principles** in the future.  
   - Refactor a problematic section of code to align with **clean code principles**.  
   - Identify potential benefits for team efficiency, code maintainability, and scalability from their solutions.  
4. **Reflection and Analysis**: After completing the task, encourage learners to:  
   - Compare the situation before and after implementing clean code practices, highlighting improvements.  
   - Suggest metrics or processes the team could adopt to monitor ongoing adherence to **clean code principles**.  
   - Reflect on how clean code practices impact collaboration and long-term project success.  

**Output:**  
A detailed scenario describing the team, their project, and the specific challenges they are facing.
