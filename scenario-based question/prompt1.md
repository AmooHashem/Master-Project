Create a single, scenario-based question that incorporates all the following topics: [insert topics, e.g., Software Lifecycle Management, Software Design, Testing, and Maintenance]. The question should:

1. Introduce a fictional team, organization, or project, describing their roles and the context of their work.
2. Present a real-world scenario where the team is facing challenges related to all the given topics, blending them into a cohesive problem.
3. Highlight specific problems under each topic in the context of the scenario, ensuring they interrelate (e.g., how poor lifecycle management impacts testing or maintenance).
4. Ask the reader to propose practical, actionable solutions addressing all topics, emphasizing how improvements in one area (e.g., design) might positively impact others (e.g., testing or maintenance).
5. Avoid referencing any specific book or resource. Instead, rely on principles and methodologies commonly recognized in software engineering.
