Create a single, scenario-based question that incorporates all the following topics:
[insert topics, e.g., Software Lifecycle Management, Software Design, Testing, and Maintenance]

Use the principles and best practices outlined in the latest version of SWEBOK to guide the question's creation. The question should:

1. Introduce a fictional team, organization, or project, describing their roles and the context of their work.
2. Present a real-world scenario where the team is facing challenges related to all the given topics, blending them into a cohesive problem.
3. Highlight specific problems under each topic in the context of the scenario, ensuring they interrelate (e.g., how poor lifecycle management impacts testing or maintenance).
4. Ask the reader to propose practical, actionable solutions addressing all topics, emphasizing how improvements in one area (e.g., design) might positively impact others (e.g., testing or maintenance).
5. Focus on applying SWEBOK principles and methodologies to solve the problems, ensuring the response covers the most important concepts from the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge.
Ensure that the question is structured in a way that encourages the application of best practices, guiding the reader to think critically and strategically.

The latest version of the SWEBOK document will be provided as a reference. Please ensure that your question integrates and reflects these guidelines.
